# Payment Routing Gateway for OpenAI API

This repository provides a basic skeleton for an application that implements a payment routing solution for the OpenAI API. The goal is to meter API usage, charge users appropriately, and gate access based on available credits.

## Overview

This skeleton is intended to be used as a starting point for building a full‑featured payment gateway for AI models. The backend uses an Express server with a simple `gatekeeper` middleware that checks the user’s wallet balance before making calls to the OpenAI API and logs usage for billing.

The frontend folder includes a minimal Next.js setup, which can be expanded into an interactive dashboard for users to manage their wallets, view usage, and purchase credits.

The database schema defines the tables needed to record users, projects, wallets, transactions, and usage events.

## Getting started

To get started with development, install Node dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

After installing dependencies, you can run the backend and frontend in development mode. Details of connecting the gatekeeper to OpenAI and integrating Stripe for payments should be added as you develop the application.
